#Map Visualization

For now use folium to get some maps going and to be able to demostrate value of the maps

Long term, we may need to move to mapbox for arcgis for more usability

# Dashboard

Grafana seems like a good candidate as it can host mapbox maps

Also need to display various charts related to the water, sun, etc over time.
