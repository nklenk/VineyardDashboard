# Sensor Aggregator

Initial version of sensor aggregator codebase

## MVP goals

aggregate data across sensors into a database

Stretch Goals
- Viewable online
- self healing nodes
- solar powered
- Animal activity metric
- 

### Soil moisture 
Sensor Used:

Considerations:
these vlaues can be used as both a proxy to soil drainage as well as in aggregate to indicate overall water exposure


### Sun Exposure
Sensor Used:

Considerations:
some poto sensors are binary indicating that a threshold has been crossed
Sensors used are supposed to deliver a range of values

### Solar Power
Pannel:
Board:
battery:

### Satelite Imagery

greenery score
leverage sat data from (). use pixel color as a proxy for foliage density


## Data store
On prem database with cloud backup

## Wifi Mesh
In order to used meshing the wifi needs to support ()

All raspberry pi chips (newer) have it, but a cheaper 3rd party solution is somthing that should be considered.
